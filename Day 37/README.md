⭐ **Day 37: Reputation System Smart Contract**

 🔍 **Overview**
For **Day 37** of my **100 Smart Contracts in 100 Days Challenge**, I built a **Reputation System Smart Contract** in Solidity. This contract allows **tracking and managing user reputation scores** on the blockchain.

 📜 **Key Features**
✅ **Reputation Tracking** – Each address has an **integer reputation score**.  
✅ **Dynamic Adjustments** – Reputation can be **increased or decreased**.  
✅ **Transparency** – Users can **view reputation scores** on-chain.  

 🛠️ **How It Works**
 **increaseReputation(user, amount)** – Boosts a user's reputation.  
 **decreaseReputation(user, amount)** – Lowers a user's reputation.  
 **getReputation(user)** – Retrieves a user's current reputation score.  

 🔗 **Next Steps**
🔹 Implement **role-based access control** for reputation updates.  
🔹 Introduce **reputation-based rewards or penalties**.  
🔹 Enable **staking mechanisms** for reputation recovery.
