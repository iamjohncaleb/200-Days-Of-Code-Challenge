  <h3 align="center">Day 9 📅 Voting Smart Contract </h3>
</div>

🔍 **Overview**  
Today, I developed a **voting smart contract** that allows users to vote for predefined proposals. The contract ensures fairness by restricting multiple votes per user.  

📜 **Key Features**  
✅ Owner initializes the voting system with multiple proposals  
✅ Users can vote **only once** for a proposal  
✅ Votes are counted, and a **winner** can be determined  
✅ Secure and transparent voting process  

🛠️ **How It Works**  
1️⃣ The contract deploys with a list of proposals  
2️⃣ Each user can vote only once for a proposal  
3️⃣ The proposal with the most votes wins  
4️⃣ The winner can be retrieved via `getWinner()`  

🔗 **Next Steps**  
- Implement **role-based access control** for adding new proposals  
- Enable **voting deadline** for time-bound elections  
- Store **voter identities** on-chain for more secure voting
