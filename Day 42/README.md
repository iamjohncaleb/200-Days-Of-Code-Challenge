## 🔍 Overview
Today’s build is a **Classified Document Access Control Smart Contract** — a decentralized, permissioned system to manage access to sensitive document content securely on-chain.

## 📜 Key Features
✅ Role-based admin and authorized user management  
✅ Secure, on-chain classified document storage  
✅ Grant/revoke access to specific addresses  
✅ Log document creation and access events  

## 🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Contract owner (admin) deploys and controls document access  
2️⃣ Documents are added by admin and stored against unique IDs  
3️⃣ Admin can grant or revoke address access  
4️⃣ Only authorized users can view classified documents  

## 🚀 Setup and Running the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
2️⃣ Compile the Smart Contract
bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat compile
3️⃣ Deploy the Contract (Localhost)
bash

Edit
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
4️⃣ Run Tests
bash
