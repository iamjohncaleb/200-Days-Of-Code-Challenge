📅 **Day 39: Multi-Signature Wallet Smart Contract**

🔍 **Overview**
For **Day 39** of my **100 Smart Contracts in 100 Days Challenge**, I implemented a **Multi-Signature Wallet**. This contract **requires multiple approvals** before executing transactions, improving security and decentralization.

📜 **Key Features**
✅ **Multiple Owners** – A group of predefined owners manage funds together.  
✅ **Approval Mechanism** – Transactions need a minimum number of approvals before execution.  
✅ **Secure Execution** – Only approved transactions are executed.  

🛠️ **How It Works**
1️⃣ Owners propose transactions using **createTransaction(to, value)**.  
2️⃣ Other owners approve transactions with **approveTransaction(txId)**.  
3️⃣ Once approvals meet the required threshold, the contract **executes the transaction**.  

🔗 **Next Steps**
🔹 Add **revocation feature** for owners to remove approvals.  
🔹 Implement **ERC20 token support** in addition to ETH transactions.  
🔹 Improve **frontend UI** for better user experience.
