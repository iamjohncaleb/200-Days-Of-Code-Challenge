  <h3 align="center">Day 8 📅 Lottery Smart Contract</h3>
</div>

🔍 **Overview**  
Today, I built a **Lottery smart contract** that allows users to enter by sending ETH, with a randomly selected winner receiving the entire prize pool.  

📜 **Key Features**  
✅ Users enter by sending at least **0.01 ETH**  
✅ The contract randomly picks a winner  
✅ The entire balance is transferred to the winner  
✅ Only the **owner** can pick the winner  

🛠️ **How It Works**  
1️⃣ Players enter the lottery by sending **ETH**  
2️⃣ The contract stores participants in an array  
3️⃣ The owner picks a random winner using `keccak256`  
4️⃣ Funds are transferred, and the lottery resets  

🔗 **Next Steps**  
- Improve randomness (VRF or Chainlink integration)  
- Implement an automated winner selection mechanism
