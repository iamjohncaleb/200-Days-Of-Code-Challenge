📅 **Day 38: Subscription Service Smart Contract**

 🔍 **Overview**
For **Day 38** of my **100 Smart Contracts in 100 Days Challenge**, I built a **Subscription Service Smart Contract** in Solidity. This contract enables users to **subscribe to a service by paying a fixed fee**.

 📜 **Key Features**
✅ **Fixed Subscription Fee** – Users pay **0.05 ETH** per subscription cycle.  
✅ **Time-based Access** – Subscriptions last for **30 days**.  
✅ **Auto-extension** – Renewing extends the current subscription period.  
✅ **Status Check** – Users can verify if they have an **active subscription**.

🛠️ **How It Works**
 **subscribe()** – Users pay **0.05 ETH** to activate or extend their subscription.  
 **checkSubscription(user)** – Returns `true` if a user’s subscription is still active.  

 🔗 **Next Steps**
🔹 Implement **tiered subscription plans** with different benefits.  
🔹 Allow **ERC20 token payments** for greater flexibility.  
🔹 Integrate **NFT-based memberships** for exclusive access.
